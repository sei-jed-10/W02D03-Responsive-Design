## What are the most common dimensions for a website design?

 Why don't you tell me! http://screensiz.es

#### Examples of non-responsive sites:

It is becoming harder and harder to find non-responsive websites. But here is an example 
of a [non-responsive 
website](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-non-responsive) for you to try 
out.

#### Examples of mobile specific sites:
One way to create optimal experiences for mobile users is a dedicated mobile site.

You know you're on one when you see `m.` in the url!

Compare https://m.xkcd.com with https://xkcd.com

Avoid these... please.

#### Examples of responsive sites:

- [Boston Globe](http://www.bostonglobe.com/)  
- [GA](https://generalassemb.ly/)
- [Responsive Meme](http://responsivememe.webflow.io/)


What's the difference between these? Let's resize again.
Interestingly, **Boston Globe was the first example of a responsive website.**

Instead of manually resizing the page, which can be a pain, we can use Google Chrome 
DevTools.


**Chrome DevTools in Action:**

- Let's visit GA's homepage
- Click on the device icon next to the magnifying glass
- You can change the pixel width (displayed at the top) using the drag tool
- You can select any device using the dropdown menu at the top
